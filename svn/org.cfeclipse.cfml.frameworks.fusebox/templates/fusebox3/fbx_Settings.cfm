Uncomment this if you wish to have code specific that only executes if the circuit running is the home circuit.
<cfif fusebox.IsHomeCircuit>
	<!--- put settings here that you want to execute only when this is the application's home circuit (for example "<cfapplication>" )--->
<cfelse>
	<!--- put settings here that you want to execute only when this is not an application's home circuit --->
