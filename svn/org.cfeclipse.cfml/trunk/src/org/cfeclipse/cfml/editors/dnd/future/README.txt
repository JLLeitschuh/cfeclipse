the classes in here will be useful in the future perhaps, when the editor
behaves more like it's theoretically supposed to.

Currently something is wonky and a plugin adapter/CFMLTransfer deal is just not 
happening.

if we ever get *super* crazy this stuff will be handy, unless it's so far in the
future that everything is different (Eclipse ~3.8 or 4+ prolly?).

This stuff is months old already but I figured I put it here for someone to find
versus a branch that nobody will check out, so to speak.  eh.
