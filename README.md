CFEclipse Project
=================
The goal of the CFEclipse project is to create a plugin for the Eclipse platform that provides a professional quality IDE for CFML developers. CFEclipse offers all of the features found in traditional CFML editors and several that are unique to CFEclipse.

As well as allowing developers to take advantage of the wealth of other Eclipse plugins, CFEclipse comes with a developer friendly price tag... It's FREE!

CFEclipse is an open-source project solely supported by volunteers!
