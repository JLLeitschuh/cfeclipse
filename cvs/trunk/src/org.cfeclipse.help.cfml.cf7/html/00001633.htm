<h1>Development tools and example code</h1>
<p>ColdFusion&#160;MX provides the following tools and example code for developing your own event gateways and event gateway applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   An SMS client (phone simulator) and a short message service center (SMSC) server simulator, for developing SMS applications without requiring an external SMS provider.
</li>
<li>
   Four sample event gateways with source code:
<ul><li>A template for an empty event gateway that contains a skeleton on which you can build your own event gateways</li>
<li>A TCP/IP socket event gateway that listens on a TCP/IP port</li>
<li>A directory watcher event gateway that monitors changes to the contents of a directory</li>
<li>A Java Messaging Service (JMS) gateway that acts as a JMS consumer or producer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
   Several sample applications, including the following:
<ul><li>A menu application that uses an inquiry-response drill-down menu to provide services such as weather reports and stock quotes.</li>
<li>A simple echo application that sends back the messages that it receives.</li>
<li>A temperature converter, an asynchronous logging application.</li>
<li>An application that returns employee phone number and other information.</li>
<p>The chapters in this manual use these example applications. </p>
</ul></li>
<li>
   Javadoc documentation for the Java interfaces and classes that you use to create gateways.
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on these examples, see <a href="00001648.htm#132552">Using the example event gateways and gateway applications</a>.</p>
