<h1>Real numbers</h1>
<p>Real numbers, numbers with a decimal part, are also known as floating point numbers. ColdFusion real numbers can range from approximately -10300 to approximately 10300. A real number can have up to 12 significant digits. As with integers, you can assign a variable a value with more digits, but the data is stored as a string. The string is converted to a real number, and can lose precision, when you use it in an arithmetic expression.</p>
<p>You can represent real numbers in scientific notation. This format is <i>x</i>E<i>y</i>, where <i>x</i> is a positive or negative real number in the range 1.0 (inclusive) to 10 (exclusive), and <i>y</i> is an integer. The value of a number in scientific notation is x times 10y. For example, 4.0E2 is 4.0 times 102, which equals 400. Similarly, 2.5E-2 is 2.5 times 10-2, which equals 0.025. Scientific notation is useful for writing very large and very small numbers.</p>
