<h1>Data source access and queries</h1>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: You cannot make a connection to the database.</p>
<p>You must create the data source before you can connect. Connection errors can include problems with the location of files, network connections, and database client library configuration.</p>
<p>Create data sources before you refer to them in your application source files. Verify that you can connect to the database by clicking the Verify button on the Data Sources page of the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator. If you are unable to make a simple connection from that page, you might need to consult your database administrator to help solve the problem.</p>
<p>Also, check the spelling of the data source name.</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Queries take too long.</p>
<p>Copy and paste the query from the Queries section of the debugging output into your database&#39;s query analysis tool. Then retrieve and analyze the execution plan generated by the database server&#39;s query optimizer. (The method for doing this varies from dbms to dbms.) The most common cause of slow queries is the lack of a useful index to optimize the data retrieval. In general, avoid table scans (or &quot;clustered index&quot; scans) whenever possible.</p>
