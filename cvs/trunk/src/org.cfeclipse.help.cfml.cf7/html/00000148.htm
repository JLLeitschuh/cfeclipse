<h1>Lesson 6: Creating a Main Application Page</h1>
<p>In this lesson you will enhance the Compass Travel Trip Maintenance application. So far, you created a very useful drill-down query facility. Compass Travel trip coordinators can produce lists required by management and easily locate and display information about any trip. There are several requirements that were identified in <a href="00000102.htm#1155250">Lesson 1: Preparing to Build the Sample&#160;Application</a> that you have not yet addressed: </p>
<ul>
<li>
   The ability to browse through the Trips table.
</li>
<li>
   The ability to add, delete, and edit trip information.
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will modify the Trip Detail page to accomplish this additional functionality. The Trip Detail page shows information about a single trip. You will convert the Trip Detail page into the main application page by adding the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   Navigation buttons to browse the database
</li>
<li>
   Database maintenance buttons to edit, delete, and add new trips, as well as a button to search 
</li>
</ul>
<p>This lesson contains the following exercises:</p>
