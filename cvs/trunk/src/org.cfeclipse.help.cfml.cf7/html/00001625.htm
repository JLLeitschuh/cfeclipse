<h1>Using Event Gateways</h1>
<p>This chapter provides an introduction to Macromedia ColdFusion&#160;MX event gateways, and provides information on how to write applications that use these gateways. It also describes how to configure an event gateway for an application and how to deploy the application. The final sections of the chapter describe some of the event gateways and example applications that are provided with ColdFusion&#160;MX, and how to use them. Subsequent chapters describe how to write applications that use the instant messaging and SMS event gateway types that are provided with ColdFusion&#160;MX, and how to develop your own event gateways. </p>
<p>This chapter assumes that developers who write applications that use event gateways have a thorough knowledge of ColdFusion development concepts and practices, including ColdFusion components (CFCs). Developers who are writing applications for custom gateways that are not provided in ColdFusion&#160;MX must also know the details of the event gateway they are using and its requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>ColdFusion&#160;MX Standard Edition does not support event gateways. In ColdFusion&#160;MX Developer Edition, some gateway types supplied with ColdFusion&#160;MX impose connection limitations.</p><h3><a name="wp139536"></a>Contents</h3>
