<h1>How to proceed</h1>
<p>Each lesson in the tutorial is designed to let you proceed at your own pace. At any time, you can stop and later return to that place in a lesson so that you can complete all the sections in the lesson.</p>
<p>Each lesson guides you through a scenario to enhance the Compass Travel Trip Maintenance application. Sections within a lesson present basic programming concepts that you need to understand before completing the section exercises. </p>
<p>Depending on your programming experience, you can read the entire lesson and then proceed to the hands-on exercises, or you can skip some information in the lesson and proceed directly to the exercises. For each exercise, there is a completed version of each file created or modified in that lesson. The completed solution files are in the directory <i>cf_root</i>/cfdocs/getting_started/solutions. Appended to each filename is the lesson and exercise number. For example, the version of the file tripdetail.cfm that you would have after performing the steps in Lesson 5, Exercise 4 is named tripdetail_lesson5_ex4.cfm. To use the solution file and continue with Lesson 5, Exercise 5, copy the tripdetail_lesson5_ex4.cfm file to the <i>cf_root</i>/cfdocs/my_app directory, and overwrite the tripdetail.cfm file if it already exists in the my_app directory.</p>
