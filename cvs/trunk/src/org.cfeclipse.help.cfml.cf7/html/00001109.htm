<h1>Other application-level settings and functions</h1>
<p>This section describes the techniques used prior to ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 to define application-level settings, variables, and functions. Macromedia recommends that you do not use these techniques in new code that you write; instead, you should use the Application.cfc file and its variables and methods, which provide more features and include logical, hierarchical structure. </p>
<p>If you do not have an Application.cfc file, ColdFusion processes the following two pages, if they are available, every time it processes any page in the application:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   The Application.cfm page is processed before each page in the application.
</li>
<li>
   The OnRequestEnd.cfm page is processed after each page in the application.
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>UNIX systems are case-sensitive. To ensure that your pages work on UNIX, always capitalize the A in Application.cfm and the O, R, and E in OnRequestEnd.cfm.</p><p>The Application.cfm page can define the application. It can contain the <a href="00000217.htm#1097308"><code>cfapplication</code></a> tag that specifies the application name, and code on this page is processed for all pages in the application. This page can define application-level settings, functions, and features.</p>
<p>The OnRequestEnd.cfm page is used in fewer applications than the Application.cfm page. It lets you provide common clean-up code that gets processed after all application pages, or specify dynamic footer pages. </p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>The OnRequestEnd.cfm page does not execute if the page invokes a <code>cflocation</code> tag. </p><p>For more information on the Application.cfm and OnRequestEnd.cfm pages, see <a href="00001124.htm#1194236">Using an Application.cfm page</a>. For information on placing these pages in the application directory structure, see <a href="00001111.htm#1165302">Structuring an application</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You can create a ColdFusion application without using an Application.cfc, Application.cfm, or OnRequestEnd.cfm page. However, it is much easier to use the Application.cfm page than to have each page in the application use a <code>cfapplication</code> tag and define common application elements.</p>
