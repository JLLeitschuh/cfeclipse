<h1>The application framework</h1>
<p>The application framework is the overall structure of the application and how your directory structure and application pages reflect that structure. You can use a single application framework to structure multiple ColdFusion applications into a single website or Internet application. You can structure a ColdFusion application by using many methodologies. For example, the Fusebox application development methodology is one popular framework for developing ColdFusion web applications. (For more information on Fusebox, see <a href="http://www.fusebox.org" target="mm_window">www.fusebox.org</a>.)</p>
<p>This chapter does not provide information on how to use or develop a specific application framework. However, it does discuss the tools that ColdFusion&#160;MX provides for building your framework, including the Application.cfc file, how an application's directory structure affects the application, and how you can map the directory structure. For more information on mapping the application framework, see <a href="00001111.htm#1165302">Structuring an application</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>For one example of an application framework, see &quot;ColdFusion Methodologies for Content Management,&quot; available at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/server_archive/articles/cf_methodologies_for_content_mgmt.html" target="mm_window">www.macromedia.com/devnet/server_archive/articles/cf_methodologies_for_content_mgmt.html</a>.</p>
