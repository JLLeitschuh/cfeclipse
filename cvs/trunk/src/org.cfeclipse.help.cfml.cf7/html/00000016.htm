<h1>Using the built-in web server</h1>
<p>ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 has its own web server that you can use to develop ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 applications, without depending on an external web server, such as Internet Information Server (IIS), Apache, or SunONE. Macromedia does not recommend using the built-in web server in a production environment. However, it is more than suitable for development, allowing you to create virtual directories and set the default document (for example, default.cfm or index.cfm).</p>
<p>During the ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 installation, you must choose a web server. If you select the built-in web server, your web root directory is located in the <i>cf_root</i>/wwwroot directory. By default, the web server runs on port 8500. This means that to display a page in your application, you must append :8500 to the host name or IP address in the URL; for example, <br />http://localhost:8500/YourApp1/index.cfm. (If the page still does not appear, make sure that the document is located in the built-in web server's web root directory; for example, C:\CFusionMX7\wwwroot\YourApp1\index.cfm.)</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you install the Server configuration of ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 with the built-in server and port 8500 is in use, for example by ColdFusion&#160;MX or ColdFusion MX&#160;6.1, the installer starts with port 8501 and looks at up to 100 ports to find one that is not being used by an application that is running. ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 uses that port and displays a message to indicate which port it selected. </p><p>If you select an external web server, the built-in web server is deactivated.</p>
