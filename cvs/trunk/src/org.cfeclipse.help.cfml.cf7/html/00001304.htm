<h1>Advantages of using Verity</h1>
<p>Verity can index the output from queries so that you or a user can search against the record sets. Searching query results has a clear advantage over using SQL to search a database directly in speed of execution because metadata from the record sets are stored in a Verity index that is optimized for searching. </p>
<p>Performing a Verity search has the following advantages over other search methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   You can reduce the programming overhead of query constructs by allowing users to construct their own queries and execute them directly. You need to be concerned only with presenting the output to the client web browser.
</li>
<li>
   Verity can index database text fields, such as notes and product descriptions, that cannot be effectively indexed by native database tools.
</li>
<li>
   When indexing collections that contain documents in formats such as Adobe Acrobat (PDF) and Microsoft Word, Verity scans for the document title (if one was entered), in addition to the document text, and displays the title in the search results list.
</li>
<li>
   When Verity indexes web pages, it can return the URL for each document. This is a valuable document management feature.
</li>
</ul>
