<h1>Deploying event gateways and applications</h1>
<p>To deploy an event gateway application in a ColdFusion server, you must install your listener CFC and configure an gateway instance that uses the CFC. </p>
<h4>To deploy an event gateway application</h4>
<ol>
<li>
   Ensure that the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator is configured with the required event gateway type. If it is not, deploy the event gateway type as described in <a href="00001698.htm#117324">Deploying an event gateway</a>.
</li>
<li>
   If the event gateway type requires a configuration file, ensure that there is a valid file in the gateway\config directory. Some event gateways might be designed to let multiple event gateway instances share a configuration file. Others might require a separate file for each event gateway instance.
</li>
<li>
   Install the event gateway application listener CFC and any other application components. ColdFusion MX provides a <i>cf_root</i>\gateways\cfc directory as a convenient location for these CFCs, and includes a mapping in the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator page for that directory. However, ColdFusion does not require you to install the listener CFC in this directory.
</li>
<li>
   Configure an event gateway instance on the Gateways page of the Event Gateways section in the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator, as described in <a href="00001638.htm#137402">Configuring an event gateway instance</a>.
</li>
</ol>
