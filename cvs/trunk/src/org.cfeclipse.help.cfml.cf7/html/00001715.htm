<h1>Data &amp; Services section</h1>
<p>The Data &amp; Services section of the Administrator is the interface for ColdFusion&#160;MX, data sources, and Verity search and indexing features. The following table describes some common tasks that you can perform in the Data &amp; Services section of the Administrator:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <th>
Task
    </th>
    <th>
Description
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<p>Create and manage JDBC data sources</p>
    </td>
    <td>
<p>The Data Sources page lets you establish, edit, and delete JDBC data source connections for ColdFusion&#160;MX. For more information, see <a href="00001735.htm#1235436">Data Source Management</a>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
    <td>
<p>Create and maintain Verity collections</p>
    </td>
    <td>
<p>The Verity Collections page lets you create and delete Verity collections and perform maintenance operations on collections that you create. For more information, see <a href="00001715.htm#1169930">Verity Collections page</a>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<p>Define mappings for web services </p>
    </td>
    <td>
<p>The Web Services page lets you produce and consume remote application functionality over the Internet. For more information, see <a href="00001715.htm#1237960">Web Services page</a>. </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The Data &amp; Services section contains the following pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   <a href="00001715.htm#1303950">Data Sources page</a>
</li>
<li>
   <a href="00001715.htm#1169930">Verity Collections page</a>

   <a href="00001715.htm#1237960">Web Services page</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="wp1303950"></a>Data Sources page</h2>
<p>The Data Sources page lets you create, edit, and delete JDBC data sources. Before you can use a database in a ColdFusion application, you must register the data source in the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator. For more information, see <a href="00001735.htm#1235436">Data Source Management</a>. </p>
<h2><a name="wp1169930"></a>Verity Collections page</h2>
<p>ColdFusion&#160;MX includes Verity, which provides indexing and searching technology to create, populate, and manage collections of indexed data that are optimized for fast and efficient site searches.</p>
<p>A <i>collection</i> is a logical group of documents and metadata about the documents. The <i>metadata</i> includes word indexes, an internal documents table of document field information, and logical pointers to the document files.</p>
<p>For more information about building search interfaces, see <a href="00001301.htm#1164916">Building a Search Interface</a> in <i>ColdFusion MX Developer's Guide</i>.</p>
<p>ColdFusion lets you manage your collections from the Administrator. You can index, optimize, purge, or delete Verity collections that are connected to ColdFusion. You use the icons in the Actions column to perform the following actions:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <th>
Action
    </th>
    <th>
Description
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<p>Index</p>
    </td>
    <td>
<p>Analyzes the files in a collection and assembles metadata and pointers to the files.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
    <td>
<p>Optimize</p>
    </td>
    <td>
<p>Reclaims space left by deleted and changed files by consolidating collection indexes for faster searching. You should optimize collections regularly.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<p>Purge</p>
    </td>
    <td>
<p>Deletes all documents in a collection, but not the collection itself. Leaves the collection directory structure intact.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
    <td>
<p>Delete</p>
    </td>
    <td>
<p>Deletes a collection.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The Verity Search Server must be running. If this page is unable to retrieve collections, ensure that the Verity Search Server is running. For more information, see <a href="00001777.htm#1037795">Collections and the ColdFusion MX Verity architecture</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="wp1262318"></a>Verity K2 Server page</h2>
<p>You can install Verity on a different host computer from the one ColdFusion&#160;MX is running on. If this is the case, you can configure the host that ColdFusion will use when it performs search operations. If you have purchased the Verity product, you may need to use advanced settings to configure the aliases and ports of the services that ColdFusion uses. You should not need to change these values if you are running with the ColdFusion installed version of Verity. </p>
<h2><a name="wp1237960"></a>Web Services page</h2>
<p>You can use web services to produce and consume remote application functionality over the Internet. The ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator lets you register web services so that you do not have to specify the entire Web Services Description Language (WSDL) URL when you reference the web service. The first time you reference a web service, ColdFusion&#160;MX automatically registers it in the Administrator.</p>
<p>When you register a web service, you can shorten your code and change a web service's URL without editing your code. For more information, see <a href="00001530.htm#1141005">Using Web Services</a> in <i>ColdFusion MX Developer's Guide</i>.</p>
