<h1>Exercise 1: About the trip list</h1>
<p>As you recall from <a href="00000102.htm#1155250">Lesson 1: Preparing to Build the Sample&#160;Application</a>, one of the requirements for the Trip Maintenance application is the ability to generate trip listings. To help Compass Travel agents take trip reservations by telephone and in person, the trip coordinator maintains a list of current trip offerings. Years ago, the coordinator would type the list and fax it to the various Compass Travel offices in an effort to keep everyone informed. When Compass Travel built an intranet that was accessible by all offices, the trip coordinator added the following HTML web page to the site:</p>
<p><br />
<img src="images/triplist.jpg" alt="This image shows a picture of the Trip List page." border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"/>
<br />
</p>
<p>Each time the Trip List HTML page is rendered in a browser, it displays the same web page. Since the page always shows an identical trip list, it is considered a <i>static</i><strong> </strong>web page. You should only use static web pages when you are creating a page that is not likely to change often.</p>
<p>Using the static web page approach, the Trip Coordinator needs to modify all the web pages that reference trip lists when trips are added, deleted, or trip names are changed. This manual process of updating each web page can lead to inaccurate or untimely information. Luckily, Compass Travel has built a database that contains a list of trips, so you can build a more accurate and timely solution for the trip coordinator. </p>
<p>In this lesson, you will create a dynamic Trip List page to present an up-to-date list of trips on the Compass Travel website. The primary users of this component are the Compass Travel coordinators and agents, not the general public. </p>
<p>To display the information on the page, you do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
   Retrieve the data that you want to display.
</li>
<li>
   Display the data on the page.
</li>
</ol>
