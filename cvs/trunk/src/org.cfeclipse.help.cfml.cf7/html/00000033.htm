<h1>Installing an EAR file or WAR files</h1>
<p>If your computer is already running a J2EE application server, the installation wizard creates an EAR file or WAR files, which you deploy using application-server-specific tools. </p>
<p>The ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 J2EE configuration must run from an expanded directory structure. Different J2EE application servers have different functionality with regard to deployment and an expanded directory structure, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Deploy compressed archive to working directory</strong>&#160;On some J2EE application servers (such as IBM WebSphere), the deployment process expands the EAR/WAR file into a working directory and, from that point forward, the expanded directory is considered to be the application. For these application servers, you deploy the compressed EAR/WAR file and work in the resulting directory structure.</p>
<p><strong>Deploy expanded archive as working directory</strong>&#160;On other application servers (such as JRun 4 and BEA WebLogic), the deployment process expands the EAR/WAR file into a temporary directory and (conceptually), the compressed EAR/WAR file is still considered to be the application. For these application servers, you must expand the EAR/WAR file manually, and then deploy the expanded directory structure, which becomes your working directory.</p>
<p>The following sections provide installation procedures for Windows and UNIX systems. For more about deployment and configuration, see <a href="00000039.htm#128292">ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 J2EE deployment and configuration</a>.</p>
