<h1>ColdFusion MX SMS development tools</h1>
<p>ColdFusion MX provides the following tools for developing SMS applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   <a href="00001681.htm#117441">SMS test server</a>
</li>
<li>
   <a href="00001682.htm#125996">SMS client simulator</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="wp117441"></a>SMS test server</h2>
<p>The CColdFusion&#160;MX SMS test server is a lightweight SMSC simulator that listens on TCP/IP port 7901 for SMPP connection requests from other SMS resources, such as ColdFusion&#160;MX SMS gateways or the SMS client simulator. The resource supplies a user name, password, and telephone number (address). The user name and password must correspond to a name and password in the simulator's configuration file (described later in this section).</p>
<p>After the SMS test server establishes a connection, it listens for incoming messages and forwards them to the specified destination address, if the destination address also corresponds to an existing SMPP connection. </p>
<p>The SMS test server lets you develop SMS applications without having to use an external SMSC supplier such as a telecommunications provider. The server supports the ColdFusion SMS gateway <code>submit</code> and <code>submitMulti</code> commands. It also accepts, but does not deliver messages sent using the SMS gateway <code>data</code> command. It does not include any store and forward capabilities.</p>
<p>Start the SMS test server by clicking the Start SMS Test Server button on the Settings page in the Event Gateways area in the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The SMS test server does not automatically restart when you restart ColdFusion&#160;MX. You must manually restart the server if you restart ColdFusion&#160;MX.</p><p>The SMS test server reads the <i>cf_root</i>\WEB-INF\cfusion\lib\sms-test-users.txt file on J2EE configurations or cf_root\lib\sms-test-users.txt file on server configurations to get valid user names and passwords. ColdFusion&#160;MX includes a version of this file configured with several names and passwords. One valid combination is user name cf and password cf. You can edit this file to add or delete entries. The file must include a name and password entry for each user that will connect to the test server, and user entries must be separated by blank lines, as the following example shows:</p>
<pre>name=cf
password=cf

name=user1
password=user1
</pre>
