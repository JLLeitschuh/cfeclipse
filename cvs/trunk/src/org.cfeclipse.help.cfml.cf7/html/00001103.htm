<h1>About applications</h1>
<p>The term <i>application</i> can mean many things. An application can be as simple as a guest book or as sophisticated as a full Internet commerce system with catalog pages, shopping carts, and reporting.</p>
<p>n application, however, has a specific meaning in Macromedia ColdFusion&#160;MX. A ColdFusion application has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   It consists of one or more ColdFusion pages that work together and share a common set of resources. 
</li>
<li>
   All pages in the application share an application name and configuration settings as specified in an Application.cfc file or a <code>cfapplication</code> tag.
</li>
<li>
   All pages in the application share variables in the Application scope. 
</li>
<li>
   You can write application-wide event handlers for specific events, such as request start or session end.
</li>
</ul>
<p>What appears to a user to be a single application (for example, a company's website), might consist of multiple ColdFusion&#160;MX applications. </p>
<p>ColdFusion&#160;MX applications are not J2EE applications. If you do not specify an application name in your Application.cfc file or <code>cfapplication</code> tag, however, the Application scope corresponds to the J2EE application servlet context.</p>
<p>ColdFusion&#160;MX applications end when the application has been inactive for the application time-out period or the server stops. When the application times out, ColdFusion&#160;MX releases all Application scope variables. You must, therefore, select a time-out period that balances the need for clearing Application scope memory and the overhead of recreating the scope. A typical application time-out is two days.</p>
<p>ColdFusion&#160;MX applications and sessions are independent of each other. For example, if an application times out while a user's session is active, the session continues and the session context, including the user's Session scope variables, is unaffected by the application ending and restarting. </p>
<p>Although there are no definite rules about how you represent your web application as a ColdFusion application or applications, the following guidelines are useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   Application pages share a common general purpose. For example, a web storefront is typically a single ColdFusion application.
</li>
<li>
   Many, but not necessarily all, pages in a ColdFusion application share data or common code elements, such as a single login mechanism.
</li>
<li>
   Application pages share a common look and feel, often enforced by using common code elements, such as the same header and footer pages, and a common error message template.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter describes the tools that ColdFusion&#160;MX provides to create an application, and presents information on how you can develop and optimize your application.</p>
