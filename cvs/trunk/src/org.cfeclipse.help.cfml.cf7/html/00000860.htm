<h1>Using this manual</h1>
<p>This manual can to help anyone with a basic understanding of HTML learn to develop ColdFusion MX applications. However, this manual is most useful if you have basic ColdFusion experience, or have read <i>Getting Started Building ColdFusion&#160;MX Applications</i>. The <i>Getting Started Building ColdFusion&#160;MX Applications</i> manual provides an introduction to ColdFusion and helps you develop the basic knowledge that will make using this manual easier.</p>
<h2><a name="wp1053301"></a>Approaches to using this manual</h2>
<p>This section describes approaches to using this manual for beginning ColdFusion developers, developers with some experience who want to develop expertise, and advanced developers who want to learn about the new and enhanced features of ColdFusion&#160;MX.</p>
<h3><a name="wp1053320"></a>Beginning with ColdFusion</h3>
<p>If you are learning ColdFusion, it might be most effective to read this manual in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>
   <a href="00000862.htm#1096321">Introducing ColdFusion MX</a> through <a href="00000924.htm#2689636">Using Expressions and Number Signs</a> to learn the basics of CFML.
</li>
<li>
   <a href="00001230.htm#1100400">Introduction to Databases and SQL</a> through <a href="00001258.htm#1106574">Updating Your Database</a> to learn about using databases.
</li>
<li>
   <a href="00001330.htm#1096836">Introduction to Retrieving and Formatting Data</a> and <a href="00001349.htm#1102770">Building Dynamic Forms with cfform Tags</a> to learn about requesting data from users.
<p>After you read these chapters, you should have a basic understanding of the basic elements of ColdFusion, and be able to create simple ColdFusion applications. To learn to produce more complete and robust applications, you could proceed with the following chapters:</p>
</li>
<li>
   <a href="00001102.htm#1101532">Designing and Optimizing a ColdFusion&#160;Application</a> through <a href="00001208.htm#1096654">Debugging and Troubleshooting Applications</a> to learn how to build a complete ColdFusion application.
</li>
<li>
   <a href="00001263.htm#1181595">Using Query of Queries</a> to learn how to use queries effectively.
</li>
<li>
   <a href="00000950.htm#1101236">Using Arrays and Structures</a> through <a href="00001022.htm#1170255">Building and Using ColdFusion Components</a> to learn to use more advanced features of CFML, including ways to reuse code.
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can then read the remaining chapters as you add new features to your ColdFusion application.</p>
<h3><a name="wp1053377"></a>Developing an in-depth knowledge of ColdFusion</h3>
<p>If you have a basic understanding of ColdFusion as presented in <i>Getting Started Building ColdFusion&#160;MX Applications</i> or the Fast Track to ColdFusion course, you might want to start at Chapter 1 and work through to the end of the book, skipping any specialized chapters that you are unlikely to need. </p>
<h3><a name="wp1053384"></a>Learning about new and modified ColdFusion features</h3>
<p>If you are an advanced ColdFusion developer, you might want to learn about new or changed ColdFusion features. The following chapters document features that are new or substantially enhanced in ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   <a href="00001301.htm#1164916">Building a Search Interface</a>
</li>
<li>
   <a href="00001322.htm#1160419">Using Verity Search Expressions</a>
</li>
<li>
   <a href="00001349.htm#1102770">Building Dynamic Forms with cfform Tags</a>
</li>
<li>
   <a href="00001376.htm#1096836">Validating Data</a>
</li>

</li>
<li>
   <a href="00001666.htm#109411">Using the SMS Event Gateway</a>
</li>
<li>
   <a href="00001684.htm#146437">Creating Custom Event Gateways</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nearly all chapters contain information that is new in ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7, so you should also review all other chapters for useful information. The index and the table of contents are useful tools for finding new features or changed documentation.</p>
