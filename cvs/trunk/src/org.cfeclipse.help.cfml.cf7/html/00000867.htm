<h1>CFML Basics</h1>
<p>This chapter introduces and describes the basic elements of CFML. These elements make CFML a powerful tool for developing interactive web applications. Because CFML is a dynamic application development tool, it has many of the features of a programming language, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   Functions
</li>
<li>
   Expressions
</li>
<li>
   Variables and constants
</li>
<li>
   Flow-control constructs such as if-then and loops
</li>
</ul>
<p>CFML also has a &quot;language within a language,&quot; CFScript, which enables you to use a syntax similar to JavaScript for many operations.</p>
<p>This chapter introduces these elements and other basic CFML entities such as comments, data types, escape characters, and reserved words. </p>
<p>The remainder of Part I of this manual provides more detailed information on many of the basic CFML elements. The rest of this manual helps you use these elements effectively in your applications.</p>
