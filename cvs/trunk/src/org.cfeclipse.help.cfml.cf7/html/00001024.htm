<h1>CFCs and object-oriented programming</h1>
<p>CFCs are building blocks that let you develop ColdFusion code in an object-oriented manner, although CFCs do not require you to do object-oriented programming. Some of the object-oriented features of CFCs include encapsulation, inheritance, and introspection. CFC object-oriented features are similar to the object-oriented elements in other languages, like JavaScript.</p>
<p>The technique of incorporating both code and data into one object such as a CFC is known as <i>encapsulation</i>. Encapsulation lets users pass data to and get a result from your CFC without having to understand the underlying code. When you use encapsulation, you can validate data that is passed to the CFC. CFCs can also enforce data types, check for required parameters, and optionally assign default values.</p>
<p>One CFC can <i>inherit</i> the methods and properties of another CFC. Inheritance lets you build multiple specific components without rewriting the code for the basic building blocks of the components. For more information, see <a href="00001060.htm#1215030">Using inheritance and the Super keyword</a>.</p>
<p>CFCs support <i>introspection</i>; that is, they can provide information about themselves. If you display a component page directly in an HTML browser, inspect it in the ColdFusion and Macromedia Dreamweaver MX component browsers, or use the CFML <code>GetMetadata</code> function, you see information about the component. This information includes its path, property, methods, and additional information that you can specify using special documentation attributes and tags. For more information, see <a href="00001064.htm#1214870">Using introspection to get information about components</a></p>
<p>When you use a ColdFusion component, you can simply <i>invoke</i> a method in the CFC. However, typically, you create an <i>instance</i> of the CFC, and then invoke methods and refer to properties of the CFC.</p>
