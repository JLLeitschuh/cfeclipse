<h1>Designing the search criteria page</h1>
<p>When designing the search criteria page, it is a good idea to develop a list of possible queries that the user might issue when searching for the records. Most Compass Travel customers are primarily concerned with trip locations, departure dates, and price; the following is a list of the types of queries that the agents are likely to require at Compass Travel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   List the trips located in Hawaii.
</li>
<li>
   Identify the trips with a price greater than $3,000.
</li>
<li>
   Show the trips departing after 11/11/2005 that are priced less than $2,000.
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of considerations to take into account when you design a search page to capture the user's search criteria. The following are two of the most important considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   For which database columns will the user be allowed to specify a search condition?
</li>
<li>
   Should the user be allowed to identify which database columns to include in the record set?
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this exercise, the Compass Travel trip coordinator searches the trips based on tripLocation, departureDate, and price. Because these columns are the only ones that users can query, they are the only ones contained in the WHERE clause of the generated SQL statement. In addition, the coordinator has no control over which columns are returned in the record set. The query always returns the same columns to identify a trip:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   tripName
</li>
<li>
   tripLocation
</li>
<li>
   departureDate
</li>
<li>
   returnDate
</li>
<li>
   price
</li>
<li>
   tripID
</li>
</ul>
<p>In later exercises, you will reference these columns when you build the SQL SELECT statement for the <code>cfquery</code> in the search action page. </p>
