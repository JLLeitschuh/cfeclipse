<h1>Packaging applications in CAR files</h1>
<p>CAR files let you archive and deploy website configuration information, files, and applications. Use this feature to deploy your website applications to another location or to back up your files quickly and easily. You manage CAR files using the Packaging &amp; Deployment &gt; ColdFusion Archives area of the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>CAR file archiving and deployment is different from J2EE archiving and packaging through EAR and WAR files.   </p><p>Perform the following steps when you archive and deploy site information:</p>
<ol>
<li>
   Create the archive definition.
<p>Identify the type of information to archive about a site. You can archive almost anything about the site, including directories, files, CFX tags, ColdFusion MX mappings, Verity collections, automated tasks, and server settings. Each archive definition that you create is assigned a name. You use this name each time you build or deploy its content. </p>
</li>
<li>
   Build the archive.
<p>Select the name of the archive definition and specify a location to which you store the CAR&#160;file. </p>
</li>
<li>
   Deploy the archive.
<p>Specify the location of the CAR file and the location to which you restore the contents.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>ColdFusion&#160;MX does not deploy Administrator and RDS passwords, nor does it unpack archives created in previous versions of ColdFusion.</p><p>For more information on creating, building, and deploying CAR files, see ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator online Help.</p>
