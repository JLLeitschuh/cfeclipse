<h1>Using the event gateway error log file</h1>
<p>When a standard ColdFusion&#160;MX event gateway encounters an error that does not prevent the event gateway from continuing to process, it logs it to the eventgateway.log file in the ColdFusion MX logs directory. Other event gateways can also to log information in this file, or to other application-specific files in the logs directory. </p>
<p>The standard ColdFusion&#160;MX event gateways log errors in interaction with any messaging server, errors in messages sent by the ColdFusion application, and recoverable errors in event gateway operation. The event gateways also log informational status messages for significant normal events, including event gateway initialization and restarts.</p>
<p>ColdFusion&#160;MX event gateway messages in the eventgateway.log file normally have the following format:</p>
<pre><i>gatewayType</i> (<i>gatewayID</i>) <i>message body</i>
</pre><p>When you are developing an event gateway application, you can use the ColdFusion Log viewer to inspect the eventgateway.log file and filter the display by using the gateway type and possibly the gateway ID as keywords. By selecting different severity levels, you can get a good understanding of errors and possible inefficiencies in your application and event gateway operation.</p>
