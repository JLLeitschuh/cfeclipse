<h1>About the ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 installation</h1>
<p>ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 provides a powerful and flexible installation and upgrade process. The ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 installation process includes the following phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
   Plan the installation. You determine your installation, configuration, and upgrade options.
</li>
<li>
   Run the installer. You run the ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 installer.
</li>
<li>
   (J2EE configuration only) Deploy ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7. You deploy and configure ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 on your J2EE application server.
</li>
</ol>
<p>The ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 installation process supports the following scenarios:</p>
<p><strong>New installation</strong>&#160;Install ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 on a computer with no previous ColdFusion installation.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade installation</strong>&#160;You can upgrade from ColdFusion 4.5, ColdFusion 5, ColdFusion MX, and ColdFusion MX&#160;6.1. When upgrading from ColdFusion 4.5, or 5, the installer migrates previous settings to ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7. When upgrading from ColdFusion MX or ColdFusion MX 6.1, the installer preserves the existing settings and installs in a new directory, automatically assigning ports that do not conflict with the existing installation.</p>
<p>You can install ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 in any of the following configurations:</p>
<p><strong>Server configuration</strong>&#160;Lets you install one instance of ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 with an embedded J2EE server. This configuration most closely resembles the ColdFusion MX base release and other releases prior to ColdFusion MX, such as ColdFusion 5 and ColdFusion 4.5. This was formerly known as the stand-alone configuration. For information on installing the server configuration, see <a href="00000007.htm#1112861">Installing the Server Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Multiserver configuration (Enterprise Edition only)</strong>&#160;Installs JRun and automatically deploys ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 in a separate JRun server instance. This configuration supports server instance creation and ColdFusion deployment in the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator and lets you manage ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 deployments on multiple JRun servers. For information on installing the multiserver configuration, see <a href="00000020.htm#109411">Installing the Multiserver Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>J2EE configuration (Enterprise Edition only)</strong>&#160;Lets you deploy ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 as a Java application running on a Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) application server, either using the bundled license of JRun or using a third-party J2EE server, such as IBM WebSphere or BEA WebLogic. When you use the J2EE configuration, you can deploy ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 multiple times on a single computer. For information on installing the J2EE configuration, see <a href="00000029.htm#109411">Installing the J2EE Configuration</a>. </p>
<p>The remainder of this chapter describes product editions and system requirements. After you understand the editions and ensure that your environment meets the system requirements, continue with the instructions in <a href="00000007.htm#1112861">Installing the Server Configuration</a> <a href="00000020.htm#109411">Installing the Multiserver Configuration</a>, or <a href="00000029.htm#109411">Installing the J2EE Configuration</a>, as appropriate.</p>
