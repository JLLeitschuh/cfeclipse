<h1>General processing options</h1>
<p>The mkvdk utility provides a variety of general processing options, which the following table describes:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <th>
Option
    </th>
    <th>
Description
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<pre>-collection path
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Specifies the path of the collection to create or open. This option is required to execute the mkvdk utility.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
    <td>
<pre>-nolock
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Turns off file locking. Locking is on by default.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<pre>-synch
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Performs work immediately. If this option is not used, indexing work is done in the background, as time permits.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
    <td>
<pre>-about
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Shows information about the collection, such as its description and the date when it was last modified.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<pre>-datapath path
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Specifies the datapath to use to find documents that are added to the specified collection. All relative document paths are relative to this setting. If you do not set this option, the mkvdk utility looks for documents next to the collection directory.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
    <td>
<pre>-topicset path
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Creates a topic index for the collection, based on the specified topic set, and stores it in the collection directory. This facilitates quick and efficient searches over the collection data when using topics.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<pre>-mode mode
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Sets the indexing mode. Values are case-insensitive. The following are the valid settings: </p>
<ul>
<li>
   Generic
</li>
<li>
   FastSearch
</li>
<li>
   NewsfeedIdx
</li>
<li>
   NewsfeedOpt
</li>
<li>
   BulkLoad
</li>
<li>
   ReadOnly
</li>
<li>
   Any custom mode defined in the style.plc file. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>The default is Generic mode. </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
    <td>
<pre>-common
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Specifies the path of the Verity common directory. If you do not use this option, the Verity engine looks for the common directory in the directory containing the mkvdk executable, and then along the executable search path. The executable search path is determined by your operating system environment settings. It is the path used by the OS to find the programs you run.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

<pre>-help

<p>Runs the mkvdk command in debugging mode.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<pre>-nooptimize
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Prevents optimization by this instance of the mkvdk utility. Using this option turns off the service-level VdkServiceType_Optimize. The service types determine the type of work the Verity engine and its self-administration features will execute on a collection.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
    <td>
<pre>-nohousekeep
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Prevents housekeeping by this instance of the mkvdk utility. Housekeeping includes deleting files that are no longer needed. Using this option turns off the service-level VdkServiceType_DBA. (Service types are described under <br /><code>-nooptimize</code>.)</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<pre>-noindex
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Prevents indexing by this instance of mkvdk. Documents are not inserted or deleted. Using this option turns off the service-level VdkServiceType_Index. (Service types are described under <code>-nooptimize</code>.)</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
    <td>
<pre>-charmap name
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Specifies the name of the character set to which to map all strings for your application. Set this to a character set that your system can display properly. Using the search engine with the English locale, the character set that any version of Windows displays is 8859. This is NOT the name of the character set of documents being indexed, it is only the name of the character set that your display can handle properly. (The character set of the document is set in the style.dft file using the /charmap option.) </p>
<p>Valid options are 850 and 8859. The default is no mapping.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<pre>-locale name
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Specifies the name of the Verity locale to be used by the mkvdk utility. The locale name must correspond to the name of an existing locale directory, which must exist in the install_dir/common/locale directory. Valid options are english, deutsch, and francais. The default is english.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#F8F8F8">
    <td>
<pre>-datefmt format
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Converts a date field value into Verity's internal data representation. You can use this option in conjunction with the mkvdk options <code>-extract</code> (for the field extraction feature) and <code>-bulk</code> (for the bulk submit feature). The named format string identifies to the date parsing routines in what order dates are written when the date string only consists of a sequence of numbers (for example, 03/03/96). Valid options are described in <a href="00001805.htm#1018477">Date format options</a>. The default is MDY.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<pre>-servlev level
</pre>    </td>
    <td>
<p>Specifies service level. The specifier, level, is a string consisting of keywords separated by hyphens, such as search-index-optimize. Valid keywords are described in <a href="00001806.htm#1018511">Service-level keyword options</a>. </p>
    </td>

<h3><a name="wp1018456"></a>Examples: processing documents</h3>
<p>The following examples show the commands for processing documents.</p>
<h4><a name="wp1018458"></a>Using the default options</h4>
<p>By default, the mkvdk command submits and indexes documents specified in the command, and services the specified collection. The following command executes the default options:</p>
<pre>mkvdk -collection path filespec
</pre><h4><a name="wp1018461"></a>Servicing only</h4>
<p>The following command performs servicing only. Use this command to only index submitted documents and service the collection:</p>
<pre>mkvdk -collection path
</pre><h4><a name="wp1018464"></a>Deleting documents from a collection</h4>
<p>The following command deletes documents from a collection:</p>
<pre>mkvdk -delete -collection path filespec
</pre><h4><a name="wp1018467"></a>Bulk inserting or deleting</h4>
<p>The following command specifies bulk insertion of a list of documents:</p>
<pre>mkvdk -collection coll -bulk -insert filespec
</pre><p>Where filespec is the list of files to insert. Since insert is the default, the following command is equivalent to the preceding command:</p>
<pre>mkvdk -collection coll -bulk filespec
</pre><p>The following command specifies bulk deletion of a list of documents:</p>
<pre>mkvdk -collection coll -bulk -delete filespec
</pre><p>Where filespec is the list of files to delete. It can be the same file used to insert documents; the only difference is that <code>-delete</code> is specified instead of <code>-insert</code> (or no specification).</p>
