<h1>Building applications with CFML</h1>
<p>You build ColdFusion applications as a series of pages that use CFML. Developers can extend this language by creating their own custom tags or user-defined functions (UDF), or by integrating COM, C++, and Java components, such as Java Server Page (JSP) tag libraries. </p>
<h2><a name="wp1160959"></a>Interacting with data sources</h2>
<p>ColdFusion applications can interact with any database that supports a JDBC technology-based driver. A JDBC technology-based driver uses an Application Programming Interface (API) to execute SQL statements to databases on most platforms. However, ColdFusion is not limited to JDBC data sources. You can also interact with existing Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) data sources by using ODBC Socket, a driver that interacts with an existing ODBC driver. </p>
<h2><a name="wp1161087"></a>Interacting with mobile devices</h2>
<p>ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 lets you create applications that can respond to events and messages from diverse sources, including instant messaging, mobile phone Short Message Service (SMS) text messages, Internet socket requests, and system events. For information, see <a href="00001625.htm#109411">Using Event Gateways</a> in <i>ColdFusion MX Developer's Guide</i>.</p>
<h2><a name="wp1167524"></a>Development tools</h2>
<p>You can code your ColdFusion application with NotePad or any HTML editor; however, Macromedia recommends that you build your applications using Macromedia Dreamweaver MX. Dreamweaver MX offers features and wizards that enhance ColdFusion development. For more information about Dreamweaver MX, see <a href="00000111.htm#1141005">Lesson 2: Configuring Your Development&#160;Environment</a>.</p>
