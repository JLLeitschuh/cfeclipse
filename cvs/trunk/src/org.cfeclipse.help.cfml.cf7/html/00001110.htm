<h1>Application security and user identification</h1>
<p>All applications must ensure that malicious users cannot make improper use of their resources. Additionally, many applications require user identification, typically to control the portions of a site that the user can access, to control the operations that the user can perform, or to provide user-specific content. ColdFusion provides the following forms of application security to address these issues:</p>
<p><strong>Resource (file and directory-based) security</strong>&#160;Limits the ColdFusion resources, such as tags, functions, and data sources that application pages in particular directories can access. You must consider the resource security needs of your application when you design the application directory structure.</p>
<p><strong>User (programmatic) security</strong>&#160;Provides an authentication (login) mechanism and a role-based authorization mechanism to ensure that users can only access and use selected features of the application. User security also incorporates a user ID, which you can use to customize page content. To implement user security, you include security code, such as the <code>cflogin</code> and <code>cfloginuser</code> tags, in your application.</p>
