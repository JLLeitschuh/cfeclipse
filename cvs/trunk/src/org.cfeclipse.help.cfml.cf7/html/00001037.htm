<h1>Using ColdFusion components</h1>
<p>There are two ways to use a CFC:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   You can <i>instantiate</i><strong> </strong>a CFC object, which creates a CFC instance. You then invoke the methods of the instance. You can access the CFC methods and data as instance elements. You can also use the instance in the <a href="00000281.htm#2650065"><code>cfinvoke</code></a> tag to invoke the CFC methods. When you instantiate a CFC, data in the CFC is preserved as long as the CFC instance exists, and ColdFusion does not incur the overhead of creating the instance each time you call a method. 
<p>Instantiate CFCs to preserve data in the CFC. To ensure processing efficiency if you use the CFC more than once on a page, instantiate the CFC before you invoke its methods.</p>
<p>Methods that are executed remotely through Flash Remoting and web services always create a new instance of the CFC before executing the method.</p>
</li>
<li>
   You can<strong> </strong><i>invoke</i> (call) a method of the CFC without creating an instance of the CFC, which is referred to as <i>transiently</i> invoking a method. In this case, ColdFusion creates an instance of the CFC that exists only from the time you invoke the method until the method returns a result. No data is preserved between invocations and there is no instance of the CFC that you can reuse elsewhere in your CFML. It is considered a best practice to create an instance of a CFC before invoking any of its methods, unless your CFML request uses the CFC only once. If you transiently invoke a method frequently, consider creating a user-defined function to replace the CFC method.
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can create persistent CFCs by assigning the CFC instance to a persistent scope, such as the Session or Application scope. This way, you can create CFCs for objects, such as shopping carts or logged-in users, that must persist for sessions. You can also create CFCs that provide application-specific data and methods.</p>
