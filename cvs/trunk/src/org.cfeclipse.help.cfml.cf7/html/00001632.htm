<h1>Standard event gateways</h1>
<p>Macromedia provides several event gateways as part of ColdFusion MX. These event gateways support the following messaging protocols:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   <strong>SMS (Short Message Service)</strong>&#160;A system designed for exchanging short, often text, messages with wireless devices, such as mobile phones or pagers. For detailed information on using the SMS event gateway, see <a href="00001666.htm#109411">Using the SMS Event Gateway</a>.
</li>
<li>
   <strong>XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)</strong>&#160;An open, XML-based protocol for instant messaging. For detailed information on using the XMPP event gateway, see <a href="00001651.htm#109411">Using the Instant Messaging Event Gateways</a>.
</li>
<li>
   <strong>IBM Lotus Instant Messaging</strong> (commonly referred to as Lotus Sametime)&#160;The IBM product for real-time collaboration. For detailed information on using the Lotus Sametime event gateway, see <a href="00001651.htm#109411">Using the Instant Messaging Event Gateways</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>ColdFusion&#160;MX also provides an event gateway, the CFML asynchronous event gateway, that lets a CFML application invoke a CFC method asynchronously. This event gateway does not follow the model of providing a mechanism for exchanging messages with resources outside of ColdFusion MX. Instead, it provides a one-way path for invoking CFCs when an application does not require (indeed, cannot receive) a return value from the CFC. For detailed information on using the CFML asynchronous event gateway, see <a href="00001647.htm#137326">Using the CFML event gateway for asynchronous CFCs</a>.</p>
