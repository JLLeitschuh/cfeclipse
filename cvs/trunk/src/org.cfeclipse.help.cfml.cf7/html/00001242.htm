<h1>Sorting results</h1>
<p>By default, a database does not sort the records returned from a SQL query. In fact, you cannot guarantee that the records returned from the same query are returned in the same order each time you run the query.</p>
<p>However, if you require records in a specific order, you can write your SQL statement to sort the records returned from the database. To do so, you include an ORDER BY clause in the SQL statement.</p>
<p>For example, the following SQL statement returns the records of the table ordered by the LastName column:</p>
<pre>SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY LastName
</pre><p>You can combine multiple fields in the ORDER BY clause to perform additional sorting:</p>
<pre>SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY DepartmentID, LastName
</pre><p>This statement returns row ordered by department, then by last name within the department.</p>
