<h1>About the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator</h1>
<p>The ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator provides a browser-based interface for managing your ColdFusion environment. You can configure many settings to provide optimal levels of security and functionality. The available options are based on your edition of ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7--Standard or Enterprise--as well as your configuration: server, multiserver, or J2EE. For more information on ColdFusion&#160;MX configurations, see <a href="00000002.htm#1243814">About the ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 installation</a> in <a href="00000001.htm#1220554">Preparing to Install ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7</a> in <i>Installing and Using ColdFusion&#160;MX</i>.</p>
<p>The default location for the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator login page is:</p>
<p>http://<i>servername</i>[<i>:portnumber</i>]/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm</p>
<p>Where <i>servername</i> is the fully qualified domain name of your web server. Common values for <i>servername</i> are localhost or 127.0.0.1 (each refers to the web server on the local computer). </p>
<p>If you are using the ColdFusion built-in web server, include the port number as part of the servername. The default port number for the server configuration is 8500; for example, http://<i>servername</i>:8500/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm. The default port number for the multiserver configuration is 8300. If you are using the J2EE configuration, include the port number used by the J2EE application server's web server.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>If you were using the built-in web server in a previous version and upgraded to ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7, the installer automatically finds an unused port for the built-in web server (typically 8501).</p><p>If your ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator is on a remote computer, use the Domain Name Services (DNS) name or Internet Protocol (IP) address of the remote host.</p>
<p>To access the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator, enter the password specified when you installed ColdFusion&#160;MX.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>If you are running in a multihomed environment and have problems displaying the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator, see <a href="00001750.htm#102311">Web Server Management</a> for configuration information.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="00001701.htm#1329723">Using the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator</a>.</p>
<p>ColdFusion&#160;MX applications require a web server to process ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) pages. The server and multiserver configurations provide a built-in web server along with support for external web servers, such as Apache, IIS, and Sun ONE Web Server (formerly known as iPlanet). </p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="00001750.htm#102311">Web Server Management</a>.</p>
<p>ColdFusion&#160;MX includes Verity K2 Server search technology. Verity K2 Server is a high-performance search engine designed to process searches quickly in a high-performance, distributed system. </p>
