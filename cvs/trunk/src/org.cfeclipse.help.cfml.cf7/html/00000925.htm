<h1>Expressions</h1>
<p>ColdFusion expressions consist of <i>operands</i> and<strong> </strong><i>operators</i>. Operands are comprised of constants and variables. Operators, such as the multiplication symbol, are the verbs that act on the operands; functions are a form of operator. </p>
<p>The simplest expression consists of a single operand with no operators. Complex expressions have multiple operators and operands. The following are all ColdFusion expressions:</p>
<pre>12
MyVariable
(1 + 1)/2
&quot;father&quot; &amp; &quot;Mother&quot;
Form.divisor/Form.dividend
Round(3.14159)
</pre><p>Operators act on the operands. Some operators, such as functions with a single argument, take a single operand. Many operators, including most arithmetic and logical operators, take two operands. The following is the general form of a two-operand expression:</p>
<pre>Expression Operator Expression
</pre><p>Note that the operator is surrounded by expressions. Each expression can be a simple operand (variable or constant) or a <i>subexpression</i> consisting of more operators and expressions. Complex expressions are built up using subexpressions. For example, in the expression (1 + 1)/2, 1 + 1 is a subexpression consisting of an operator and two operands. </p>
