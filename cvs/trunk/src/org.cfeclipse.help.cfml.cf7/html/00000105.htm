<h1>Exercise 2: Determining the data requirements</h1>
<p>Prior to creating the application pages to capture trip information, you must determine what type of data is required about each trip. For the example in this tutorial, the Compass Travel trip coordinator must maintain the following information about each trip:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   Trip name
</li>
<li>
   Type of event (surfing, mountain climbing, kayaking, and so on)
</li>
<li>
   Trip description
</li>
<li>
   Trip location
</li>
<li>
   Departure date
</li>
<li>
   Return date
</li>
<li>
   Price 
</li>
<li>
   Base cost
</li>
<li>
   Assigned trip leader
</li>
<li>
   Total number of people who can attend the trip
</li>
<li>
   An indicator of whether a deposit is required
</li>
<li>
   Trip photograph
</li>
</ul>
<p>By collecting the preceding information about each trip, the Compass Travel website can market its trips online to the general public. Customers who are booking a trip need to know the trip name, when the trip begins and ends, the price, and a description. Additionally, the trip coordinator must identify the filename for a photograph of each trip. The Compass Travel website displays the photograph to further entice prospective customers into booking the trip. Finally, Compass Travel considers it important to store the base cost for each trip to help determine trip profitability. The cost must be captured, but it is for Compass Travel internal use only and is not shown on the public website. </p>
