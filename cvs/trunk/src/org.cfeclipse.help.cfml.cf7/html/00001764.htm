<h1>About ColdFusion&#160;MX security </h1>
<p>Security is especially important in web-based applications, such as those you develop in ColdFusion&#160;MX. ColdFusion developers and administrators must fully understand the security risks that could affect their development and runtime environments so they can enable and restrict access appropriately.</p>
<p>You implement <i>development security</i> by requiring a password to use the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator and a password for Remote Development Services (RDS), which allows developers to develop CFML pages remotely. You implement <i>runtime security </i>in your CFML pages and in the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator. ColdFusion&#160;MX has the following runtime security categories:</p>
<p><strong>User security</strong>&#160;Programmatically determine the logged-in user and allow or disallow restricted functionality based on the roles assigned to that user. For more information about user security, see <a href="00001176.htm#1155006">ColdFusion security features</a> in <a href="00001175.htm#1100022">Securing Applications</a> in <i>ColdFusion MX Developer's Guide</i>.</p>
<p><strong>Sandbox security</strong>&#160;Using the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator, define the actions and resources that the ColdFusion pages in and below a specified directory can use.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you have the Enterprise Edition of ColdFusion&#160;MX, you can configure multiple security sandboxes. If you have the Standard Edition of ColdFusion&#160;MX, you can only configure a single security sandbox.</p><p>The Security area in the Administrator lets you do the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   Configure password protection for the ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator. For more information, see <a href="00001765.htm#1113232">ColdFusion&#160;MX Administrator password protection</a>.
</li>
<li>
   Configure password protection for RDS access. For more information, see <a href="00001765.htm#1120216">RDS password protection</a>.
</li>
<li>
   Enable, disable, and customize ColdFusion security, on the Security &gt; Sandbox Security page (called Resource Security page in the Standard edition). For more information, see <a href="00001766.htm#1116021">Using sandbox security</a>.
</li>
</ul>
