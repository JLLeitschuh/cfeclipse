<h1>About relational tables</h1>
<p>In a database, you can organize data in multiple tables. For example, if you manage a database for the Human Resources department, you might have one table that lists all the information about employees and another table that lists all the departments:</p>

<br />
</p>
<p>You have multiple departments for employees, but you would not store the information about the departments in every employee row for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   The department information is the same for each employee in a given department; however, repeating the department information for each employee is redundant. Storing redundant data takes up more disk space.
</li>
<li>
   If the department information changes, you can update one occurrence. All references to that department are updated automatically.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Storing multiple occurrences of the same data is rarely a good thing. Good relational database design separates application entities into their own tables. Key values from one table are often stored in a related table rather than repeating the information. The key value is used to join the data between the tables to return the complete set of data required. </p>
