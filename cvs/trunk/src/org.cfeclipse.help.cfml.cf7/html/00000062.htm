<h1>Post-install problems</h1>
<h2><a name="wp117147"></a>CLOB and data corruption</h2>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You are using the Japanese version of ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 and Oracle 8/9 with NLS_Characterset JA16SJJS, and encounter CLOB corruption and data corruption. </p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Set codepageoverride=MS932 in the JDBC URL.</p>
<h2><a name="wp119788"></a>Unsupported keysize or algorithm parameters</h2>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You are running ColdFusion MX 7 on WebSphere 5.1 on IBM JVM 1.4.1 and encounter an &quot;Unsupported keysize or algorithm parameters&quot; exception.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> You must install unlimited jurisdiction policy files, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
   Download and install Unrestricted JCE Policy files for IBM SDK 1.4 from <a href="https://www6.software.ibm.com/dl/jcesdk/jcesdk-p" target="mm_window">https://www6.software.ibm.com/dl/jcesdk/jcesdk-p</a>.
</li>
<li>
   Unzip the file.
</li>
<li>
   Copy files unzipped from this link to the jre/lib/security directory.
</li>
<li>
   Restart WebSphere.
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="wp119917"></a>Virtual mapping resource path of /* does not work</h2>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You add a virtual mapping resource path of <code>/*</code> which does not work<code>.</code></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Do not map any directories to wildcard resource paths that contain WEB-INF as a virtual mapping. In ColdFusion MX 6.1, the fact that this worked was a side-effect of the particular way the classloader was configured. For ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7, the classloader is consistent across all editions; the ColdFusion classloader is no longer blended with the application server&#39;s classloader. This change was made to ensure that ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 works consistently in standalone server as well as deployed as an EAR/WAR to any certified J2EE application server.</p>
