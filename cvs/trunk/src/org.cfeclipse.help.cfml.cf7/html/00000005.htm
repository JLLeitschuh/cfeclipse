<h1>Installation considerations</h1>
<p>This section describes the following topics for installing or upgrading to ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   <a href="00000005.htm#1211318">Installation considerations for all platforms</a>
</li>
<li>
   <a href="00000005.htm#1211383">Installation considerations for Windows</a>
</li>
<li>
   <a href="00000005.htm#1217505">Installation considerations for UNIX</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>To use VisiBroker for CORBA connections in ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7, see <a href="00000052.htm#1132173">Enabling CORBA support</a>.</p><h2><a name="wp1211318"></a>Installation considerations for all platforms</h2>
<p>The following are installation considerations for all platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   Macromedia supports installing ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 side-by-side with ColdFusion MX&#160;6.1 and ColdFusion MX. Macromedia supports upgrading to ColdFusion MX 7 from ColdFusion&#160;5 and ColdFusion 4.5. If you are upgrading, you must back up your existing ColdFusion applications first.
</li>
<li>
   If you have previously installed a Beta version of ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7, you must uninstall it before you install the release version.
</li>
<li>
   Macromedia recommends using the built-in (internal port-based) web server for development, but not in a production environment.
</li>
<li>
   If you have ColdFusion 4.5 or 5 installed on your computer, ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 installs in coexist mode automatically. You can migrate ColdFusion 4.5 or ColdFusion 5 resources (such as data sources and Verity collections) to ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7.
</li>
<li>
   Previous versions of ColdFusion&#160;MX, including ColdFusion MX 6.1, can coexist with ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7; however, you cannot install ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 in the directory where ColdFusion MX&#160;6.1 resides.
<p>You can switch to use a different web server for ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 after the installation, by following the instructions for your platform and the web server in <a href="00000049.htm#1117590">Configuring web servers</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
   During installation of the server configuration, if you select the built-in web server, your web root directory is C:/CFusionMX7/wwwroot by default. This web server runs on the 8500 port. To display a page, append 8500 to the end of the host name or IP address; for example, <br />http://localhost:8500/MyApp.cfm. (If the page still does not appear, ensure that the document is located in the ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 web root directory; for example, C:/CFusionMX7/wwwroot\MyApp.cfm. For more information, see <a href="00000016.htm#1154935">Using the built-in web server</a>.
</li>
<li>
   To interact with ColdFusion pages and components from a Macromedia Flash SWF file, use the Flash Remoting service in ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7. To develop applications that use Flash Remoting, you must install the Flash Remoting components in the Flash MX authoring environment. The Flash MX authoring environment or Macromedia Flex is required to build applications that connect to and interact with the Flash Remoting service in ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7.
</li>
<li>
   By default, Macromedia Flash Remoting cannot access web services through ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>To enable Flash Remoting to access web services through ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
   Open the <i>cf_root</i>/WEB-INF/gateway-config.xml file in a text editor.
</li>
<li>
   Locate the following line.
<pre>
&lt;!--&lt;adapter&gt;coldfusion.flash.adapter.CFWSAdapter&lt;/adapter&gt;--&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>
   Remove the comments, so that the line appears as follows.
<pre>
&lt;adapter&gt;coldfusion.flash.adapter.CFWSAdapter&lt;/adapter&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>
   Save the file.
</li>
<li>
   Restart ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7.
<p>For more information on Flash Remoting, see <i>ColdFusion MX Developer's Guide</i>. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
   ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 is built in Java and when installing the server configuration, the ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 installer automatically installs the JRE that is appropriate for your platform. When installing the J2EE configuration, ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 uses the same JRE as your J2EE application server.
</li>
<li>
   In an optimal production environment, each ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 application is hosted on a dedicated server; database, mail, and other servers are not on the same computer.
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="wp1211383"></a>Installation considerations for Windows</h2>
<p>The following installation considerations are for Windows systems only:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   Do not configure the server running ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 as a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or Backup Domain Controller (BDC). Macromedia follows the Microsoft network model, in which the first level is the PDC or BDC. These systems only manage the network or domain and are not designed to run application servers. ColdFusion&#160;MX&#160;7 should reside on the second level of Microsoft Windows 2000 stand-alone systems. Stand-alone servers can participate in a network or domain.
</li>
<li>
   Windows 2000 Professional handles only ten TCP/IP connections concurrently. Therefore, Macromedia does not recommend using this operating system in a production environment; use Windows 2000 Server instead.
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="wp1217505"></a>Installation considerations for UNIX</h2>
<p>The following are installation considerations for UNIX systems only:</p>
<ul>
<li>
   For troubleshooting purposes, the installer creates the following log file during an installation or upgrade on UNIX: <i>cf_root</i>/Macromedia_ColdFusion_MX7_install.log. If you contact Macromedia Technical Support for installation support, you must send them this file.
</li>
<li>
   If you are deploying the J2EE configuration on a platform other than Linux or Solaris, use the coldfusion-70-other.jar installer. This Java-only installer does not include features that require platform-specific binary files, such as Verity and C++ CFX support.
</li>
<li>
   Macromedia does not recommend using Apple Mac OS X 10.3 in a production environment
</li>
</ul>
