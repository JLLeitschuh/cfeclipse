		// resources path. Also, if there's content in pathSoFar then we need
		// to retrieve anything that's non-path. So first off we separate the
		// pathSoFar into pre-path and postPath. Post path is used to filter
		// the set of files in the final directory.
		// Having done that we get the folder based upon the supplied resource and
		// the pre-path stuff. From that we can get the children and then
		// whip through them all testing to see if our postPath filters them
		// at all.
