<p>CFEclipse is a CFML (Cold Fusion Markup Language) plug-in for Eclipse. 
This plug-in adds a CFML script editor, syntax highlighting, and code insight 
for the CFML language. It also provides code insight for HTML 4.01, a 
specialized cfscript editor, and a snippet (HTML fragment) inserter. 
CFML is a server side scripting language that sits on top of a J2EE server. 
There are currently two companies that make engines that can process CFML 
scripts - Macromedia and New Atlanta.

<p>Until your project is approved, only you can view it and work on
it.

<ul>
<li>This index.html will be used if and only if you have the "Use
Project Home Page" option checked on the "Adminster Project" page
(click the "Admin" tab).</li>

<li>To edit this file, check out your project via CVS and edit www/index.html.

<li>You can 'cvs add' and commit other files under the project's "www"
directory and they will published to your project web site.</li>

<li>Also, consider starting a thread in the "dev" mailing list to get
thes discussion started.  A good one is an "introduction" thread where
people post messages about themselves and their interest in the
project.</li>

<li>You can add a "Highlights:" line to the top of all web pages by adding a file www/project_highlights.html </li>

<h3>Mission</h3>
<p> This project is attempting to create the best environment for 
	writing CFML code. This project does <i>not</i> intend to create an HTML
	WYSIWYG editor, or an editor with large numbers of wizards. This project 
	is attempting to make a CFML editor for coders.
</p>

<!-- <p>What is the goal of this project?
</p>

<p>What is the scope of this project?
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop just enough functionality to scratch a particular itch</li>
<li>Build a tool just like XYZ, but less broken</li>
<li>Build the best XYZ-tool ever!</li>
</ul>


<p>What are high-level features you are sure to build?
</p>
<ul>

<li>What would you write on a billboard about your project? Users
might only look for a few seconds.</li>

<li>Use the issue tracker to track features and enhancement
requests. It is not just for bugs, pre-populate it with feature
descriptions so that potential contributors know what you would like them
to work on.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the high-level assumptions or ground rules for the project?
</p>

<p>For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li> we will use programming language X on operating system Y for now.

<li>We will, or will not, consider certain functional areas like
internationalization, high security, concurrency, etc.  The list of
functional areas will depend on what you are trying to do.

<li>Try to keep this part short.
</ul>
 -->

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
	To install the plug-in do the following:
	<ol>
		<li>Download the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse IDE</a> version 3.0 or higher</li>
		<li>download a <a href="#pluginlist">plug-in zip file</a></li>
		<li>Unzip the file into your eclipse/plugin directory</li>
		<li>restart Eclipse</li>
		<li>If you have an editor already linked to cfm, cfc, cfml, htm, or html files you'll need to change
			the editor setting in Window/Preferences then in the tree select Workbench/File Associations,
			and set cfm, cfc, cfml, htm and html to the CFML Editor.
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>
