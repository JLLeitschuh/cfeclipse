	<h3>Announcement: CFEclipse version 1.1.15 "Sonic" released.</h3>
	<h4>22nd July, 2004 : 22:08</h4>
<p>
Installation & update procedures are listed at the bottom of this mail.
All current non-CVS users of CFEclipse should hopefully be notified by 
Eclipse that there is a new release available. If not, follow the update
procedures and mention it to us on the CFE lists.
</p>

<h3>The Scribble Pad:</h3>
<p>
As of 1.1.15 CFE comes with a major new feature: the 'scribble pad'. The Scribble Pad 
is intended to allow you to test those random small ideas. 
</p>
<p>
To use the Scribble Pad you must first setup a project named 'Scribble' and create 
a file called 'scribble.cfm'. scribble.cfm must be a file that is on your web server
root. Now find the CFEclipse preference pages and change the 'URL to scribble file' 
in the Scribble Pad node to wherever the scribble.cfm file resides on your web server.
</p>
<p>
Now from any project you can hit F8 and your scribble file will be opened. Stick some
code in, hit F8 again and the browser will display the result of that file.
</p>
<p>
The Scribble Pad is very much a work-in-progress, so any and all ideas on it are welcome.
Best place is the CFE mailing lists at http://cfeclipse.tigris.org
As a hint, current ideas are indexing of saved scribbles, keyword association and
saved-scribble-searches to find that piece of test code that you've lost.
</p>

<h3>Other features you may enjoy:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Snippet triggers: You can now assign trigger text to each snippet. Type it in, hit Ctrl+I and your snippet is inserted.</li>
	<li>Loopy snippets: Enter your snippet trigger text plus a "*2" and get double the snippet fun.</li>
	<li>CFC Method view now has the method hints shown</li>
	<li>CFC Method view has an alphabetic sorting button</li>
	<li>Double clicking a CFC method name now sends focus to the editor.</li>
	<li>Context sensitive CFML F1 help: takes your browser to the appropriate livedocs page, otherwise to Google you go.</li>
	<li>No more duplicate attribute suggestions: type '<cffunction name="fred" ', now the name attribute has been removed from the list of available suggestions.</li>
	<li>'Jump to end tag' context menu implemented.</li>
	<li>Syntax colouring is now working. Window->Preferences->CFEclipse and then either CFML Colors or HTML Colors.</li>
	<li>'=' no longer causes content/code assist to disappear</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs fixed:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>#124 "code hints suddenly stop working"</li>
	<li>#101 "Need to check something in the content tree before usage"</li>
	<li>#156 "Paste attribute causes problem at end of tag"</li>
	<li>#148 "keyword coloring a bit off on tags"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known issues:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>'Jump to end tag' is only reliable after post-edit saving.</li>
	<li>Changes to syntax colours are not reflected in currently open editor windows. They must be closed and re-opened.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A zip version is available on the CFEclipse website if you wish to perform the installation/update manually.
